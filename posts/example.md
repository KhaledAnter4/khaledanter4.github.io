## Description

This is a placeholder blog post stored as a Markdown file. You can replace it
with a real writeup or delete it after verifying the blog pipeline.

## Impact

Using Markdown files for posts means no manual editing of `blog.html` is needed.

## Fix

Add new posts by:

1. Creating a `.md` file in the `posts` folder.
2. Adding its filename to `posts/index.json`.
